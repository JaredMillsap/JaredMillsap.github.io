    <h1> Jared Millsap </h1>
    <h1> Welcome! </h1>

    </p> Thanks for stopping by and checking out my Portfolio. I am in the early stages of my professional career as a software devloper. While growing up I have always had an interest in software development, but never was able to find the time. During Covi-19, like many, I was a fresh graduate with a business managament degree with very limited employment opportunities. I decided to pursue a passion and placed all efforts into development. My experience is with full-stack web development using the .Net framework and .core.  /p>
